# Description:

In this project, I developed a multiple linear regression model aimed at predicting car prices based on a variety of features. This work was conducted for Geely Auto, a Chinese automobile company planning to enter the US market. The goal was to help the company understand the key factors influencing car prices in the American market, which could differ from those in China, and leverage these insights to guide product design and business strategy.

# Key Highlights:

# 1.Data Preparation and Feature Engineering:

Cleaned and processed a comprehensive dataset containing various car attributes.
Extracted the car manufacturer name from the CarName variable and used it as an independent variable in the model, focusing on how different manufacturers impact car pricing.

# 2. Model Building and Evaluation:

Built a multiple linear regression model to identify significant predictors of car prices and evaluated the model's performance using statistical metrics such as R-squared.
Conducted residual analysis to ensure the model's assumptions were met and to improve its accuracy and reliability.

# 3. Test Set Performance:

Assessed the model's predictive power on a test dataset by calculating the R-squared score, ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data.
Outcome: The resulting model provides actionable insights into the factors that most significantly affect car prices in the US, helping Geely Auto to make informed decisions regarding their entry into the market. This project also demonstrates proficiency in data preprocessing, regression modeling, and the interpretation of statistical results.

# Tools and Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook
